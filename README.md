# Signals-System
 ## Assignment description

Sensors are really important part of IOT for measuring the data obtained from the surrounding.In the programming assignment one such sensor is mentioned which records the temperatures of the surrounding and stores the obtained values in the base unit.On observing it was found that the signal in the base unit consisted of noise and blurriness. A code which can denoise and deblur was expected.

## SNS assignment Solution

This repositary consists of code files named as denoised_deblurred,deblurred_denoised,newplots and a report which explains the observations and all the conclusions.The excel file consists data of the signal.

## How to run the code

For this code to run MATLAB software is necessary.
The solution code consists of 3 MATLAB files in   .m form.The files are arranged in a particular manner and they should run in that order so as to get expected and proper output without errors.The denoised_deblurred file should run first then deblurred_denoised and then newplots file.Report is in microsoft word document format and readme file is in .md format which can be easily opened in code editors like VScode etc.
